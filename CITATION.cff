abstract: >-
  To model dense crowds, the usual recourse to oversimplified (circular) pedestrian
  shapes and contact forces shows limitations. To help modellers overcome these
  limitations, we propose an open-source numerical tool. It consists of a Python
  library that generates 2D and 3D pedestrian crowds based on anthropometric data,
  and a C++ library that computes mechanical contacts with other agents and with
  obstacles, and evolves the crowd's configuration. Additionally, we provide an
  online platform with a user-friendly graphical interface for the Python library,
  and scripts to call the C++ library from Python. The tool enables users to
  implement their own decisional layer, i.e., to control the agents' choices of
  desired velocities.
