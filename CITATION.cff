abstract: >-
  To model dense crowds, the usual recourse to oversimplified (circular)
  pedestrian shapes and contact forces shows limitations. To help modellers
  overcome these limitations, we propose an open-source numerical tool. It
  consists of a Python library that generates 2D and 3D pedestrian crowds
  based on anthropometric data, and a C++ library that computes
  mechanical contacts with other agents and with obstacles, and evolves the
  crowd's configuration. Additionally, we provide an online platform with a
  user-friendly graphical interface for the first library, and scripts to call
  the second library from Python. The tool enables users to implement
  their own decisional layer, i.e., to control the agents' choices of desired velocities.
